# Foundations Of Analysis (Landau)

This repository accompanies my corresponding [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5U-nLTI0t6RI-K_6Tejs8fnvHrzJmHXV) in which I'm transcribing Edmund Landau's "Foundations of Analysis" into FPL while explaining both, the mathematics of this work and how we can express it FPL. 

## What is FPL?
FPL, the Formal Proving Language, is an artificial language to formulate mathematical definitions, theorems, and proofs independently of 
local natural languages. 

For more information, see my public [fpl.net repo](https://github.com/bookofproofs/fpl.net). It includes the *FPL parser*, *FPL Interpreter*, an *FPL Language Server*, and a *VS Code extension* for writing FPL code.

## How to use the FPL examples in this repo?
If you want to experiment with the FPL examples in this repository, I recommend using [this VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bookofproofs.fpl-vscode-extension).

## What is Landau's "Foundations of Analysis"?

Edmund Landau's *"Foundations of Analysis"* is a short booklet, first published in 1930, about the number systems of natural, rational, real, and complex numbers and how they can be derived from the Peano Axioms. Landau wrote this booklet in a "telegraphic" style, and it is instructive to see how to transcribe it into FPL.
